My Senior Project Research Topic: Analyzing Cookie Data

------- Explanation of Research ------- 
The process for collecting the cookie data for this research was conducted very sequentially. Data was collected from five websites of five different website domains: .gov, .org, .com, .edu, and .net. For a total of 25 websites. 

One of the variables being closely observed was the last accessed and creation time attributes of the cookie. This was done in hope that if a cookie's last accessed time varied from the creation time it would suggest that the cookie was accessed from a different website. For this to hold true all the cookie data needed to be wiped before beginning the data collection process. Then once the process of data collection began, there could be no mistakes upon accidental revisitation of a website after the initial data collection. 

This process was vigorously precise. Example: Website 1 was visited. The data in the cookies.sqlite file was saved to a text file. Website 2 was visited. The cookies.sqlite file was saved to a new text file. And So On... 

Explanation of Code Files
The cookie data was saved in various files due to the complexity of the data collection. This led to a few different methods for analyzing the data files.
